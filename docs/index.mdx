Charts are a way to visually display data and gain insights into data. When we need to analyze data changes and understand data trends, we often use charts.

[AnalyCHART](/) uses a simple and easy-to-understand interactive form to draw dynamic charts, without any code, and provides a large number of reusable [examples](/examples). You can understand your data directly through charts on our website, or download charts and use them elsewhere.

## Features

**Simple and intuitive UI interaction, no code required**

Unlike other tools that draw charts through scripts, [AnalyCHART](/) controls the generation of charts through UI options, and uses a very simple UI design, which is intuitive and easy to understand.

**Dynamic rendering**

Any change in options will directly render the results, allowing you to see the results without wasting time.

**Abundant examples**

If you are unsure about the style of drawing a chart, you can refer to the chart style in the [examples](/examples); or if you donâ€™t want to spend time understanding UI options, you can also use them directly, replace the data, and generate charts without configuration.

## Getting Started

First, you need to prepare the data.

[AnalyCHART](/) supports data sources such as CSV/Excel files from local or network URLs, or directly input in the text box.

Upload or input data through the component box below:

After entering the data, you can click on the data bar to view the content of the data.

Now, you can draw the chart.

Drawing a chart is done through the options panel like this

[AnalyCHART](/) supports a range of chart styles, including line charts, area charts, bar charts, dot charts, pie charts, candlestick charts, etc. More styles are being supported. Each style is controlled by a series of similar options. Therefore, you can directly draw the chart by modifying the values of these options.

A simpler way is to check the [examples](/examples) and find a similar chart that you expect. Click "Edit" and then directly replace the data on the opened page to complete the preliminary drawing.

For example, we use the "Line Chart - Label" example

Based on this, you can adjust some options to achieve the desired effect.

## Next step

Please refer to other documents to understand the usage of various chart styles and their options.
